Majority of the African country still striving to attain social and economic development.

The statistical analyses employed are descriptive analysis to understand the summary of the dataset, correlation analysis to understand the relationship between each of the indicators, regression analysis to build a multiple linear regression model, time series analysis, and forecasting to predict any future trend in the Natural resource GDP.
